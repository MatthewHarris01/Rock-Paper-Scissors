Suggsted improvements:
(1) In the "isValid" function that screens user input, ignore the F5 (or f5) keystroke, that is not a move, but user trying ot refersh the page.
(2) In the isValid function that screens user input, ignore "escape" when user presses the Esc key, if the Esc key is pressed, reset game scores to zero.
(3) When the sum of all scores (win, lose and tie) equals or exceeds 100, show an alert to the user, and reset the game, that means the user has played 100 matches, and resetting the game is appropriate.
(4) Show wins as a percentage of losses, i.e wins/losses.
